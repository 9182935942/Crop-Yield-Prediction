**Crop Yield Prediction**
Crop Yield Prediction ðŸŒ¾  
Predicts **crop yield** based on **weather conditions, soil quality, rainfall, and temperature** using **machine learning**. Helps farmers optimize harvest timing & resource allocation.

Project Overview  
Agricultural productivity depends on several environmental factors. This project applies **data-driven insights** to estimate yield, supporting smart farming decisions.

Technologies Used  
 **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor (80.2% Accuracy)  
 **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
 **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

Features  
 **Crop yield prediction based on climate & soil conditions**  
 **Data-driven insights for farming efficiency**  
 **Feature engineering for improved prediction accuracy**  

Results  
**Rainfall & soil quality** majorly impact crop yield.  
**Random Forest model performed best**, achieving **80.2% accuracy**.
